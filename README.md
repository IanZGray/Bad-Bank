# Bad Bank

This is a shell app that uses hooks to create users, login, and alter the account balances of the logged in users.

# Description 

I built this to demonstrate the use of react hooks in a front end application. I then reformatted it to connect to a database.

# Technology used: 

React.js, Node.js, ES6, CSS, HTML, MongoDB, Express.js

# Features: 

It allows users to create an account, log in, and deposit or withdraw fake money. I'll be moving a log in/out button to the right of the nav bar, and enhancing accessibility.
